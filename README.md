# Cardinal SDK flutter boilerplate

A basic flutter application that demonstrates basic usage of the Cardinal SDK. 

To use this boilerplate you will need to configure the specId and processId in the main.dart:

```dart
        throw UnimplementedError("Fill this with the specId from the cockpit"),
        throw UnimplementedError("Fill this with the a user login/registration process for your database"),
```

You can get them by following the [onboarding process](https://docs.icure.com/cockpit/how-to/how-to-start) on the 
[Cockpit](https://cockpit.icure.cloud).
